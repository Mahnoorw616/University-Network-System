# 🏫 University Network System – Cisco Packet Tracer Project
This project simulates a complete **university network infrastructure** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, showcasing the implementation of key networking concepts such as IP addressing, VLANs, routing protocols, and access control. Built as part of the **Computer Networking Technologies** course.
---
## 📌 Project Overview
The **University Network System** is designed to replicate a real-world campus network, structured into various departments such as Administration, Faculty, Library, Students, and Labs. The project focuses on **secure, scalable, and efficient communication** between departments using industry-standard networking practices.
